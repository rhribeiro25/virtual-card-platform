# 🎫 Virtual Card Platform - Backend API

<details>
  <summary><strong><span style="font-size: 1.1em;">
    💼 Problem Overview
  </span></strong></summary>

  <br>

  You are tasked with building the backend API for a **Virtual Card Platform**. Users should be able to:
  
  - Create virtual cards
  - Add funds (top-up)
  - Spend funds from the cards
  
  The system must guarantee **data consistency**, **prevent overspending**, and remain **robust under concurrent usage**.

    🧱 Core Requirements
  </span></strong></summary>

  ##### 🏛️ Entity

  - 💳 Card 

    The Card entity represents a virtual card created by a user within the platform. It holds key information required for performing financial transactions, such as the available balance and operational status.
    
    - `id: UUID`
    - `cardholderName: String`
    - `balance: BigDecimal`
    - `createdAt: Timestamp`
  
  - 💸 Transaction

    The Transaction entity represents a financial operation executed on a virtual card. It stores information about the transaction type, amount, and the moment it occurred. Every transaction is linked to a specific card.
    
    - `id: UUID`
    - `cardId: UUID` (foreign key)
    - `type: ENUM { SPEND, TOPUP }`
    - `amount: BigDecimal`
    - `createdAt: Timestamp`

  ##### 🔌 API Endpoints
  
  - `POST /cards`
  
    - Creates a new virtual card.
    
    ```json
    {
      "cardholderName": "Alice",
      "initialBalance": 100.00
    }
    ```
  
  - `POST /cards/{id}/spend`
   
    - Returns `400 Bad Request` if balance is insufficient.
    - Must prevent double-spending via race condition handling.
    
    ```json
    {
      "amount": 30.00,
      "requestId": "UUID"
    }
    ```
  
  - `POST /cards/{id}/topup`
  
    - Adds funds to an existing card.
    
    ```json
    {
      "amount": 50.00,
      "requestId": "UUID"
    }
    ```
  
  - `GET /cards/{id}`
  
    - Retrieves card details including current balance.
    
  - `GET /cards/{id}/transactions`
    
    - Returns the full transaction history for a card.

    📝 Business Rules
  </span></strong></summary>

  <br>

  - A card's balance **can never go below zero**
  - Transactions must ensure **atomicity and consistency** (e.g., no double spend)
  - Spending from **non-existent or deleted cards** is forbidden
  - Transactions are blocked if the card is `BLOCKED`
  - Cards must exist; otherwise, return `404 Not Found`
  - A card can have a **maximum of 5 SPEND transactions per minute**
  - Duplicate transactions are avoided by checking amount and timestamp within a configurable time window

    ⚙ Implementations
  </span></strong></summary>

  - In-memory **H2 database** with versioning via **Flyway**

  - **Spring Data JPA**

  - In-memory **cache** using `@Cacheable` and `@CacheEvict`

  - 100% **test coverage** (unit and integration) with **JUnit + Mockito**

  - Transaction safety using `@Transactional` and **optimistic locking** via `@Version`

  - Proper layering: `Controller → Service (UseCase) → Repository`

  - Use of **DTOs**, **MapStruct-like mappers**, and REST best practices (HTTP 200, 201, 400, 404, 409, 500)

  - Design patterns:
      - **Template Method** for transaction execution
      - **Facade** via `CardUsecase` to encapsulate logic
      - **Builder** for creating immutable entities

  - **Jacoco** test coverage report published via GitHub Pages:

    👉 [Test Coverage Report](https://rhribeiro25.github.io/virtual-card-platform)

  - **Swagger UI** available for REST API exploration:

    👉 [Swagger Interface (localhost)](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

  - **Postman Collection** for manual testing:

    👉 [Access the file](https://github.com/rhribeiro25/virtual-card-platform/blob/main/src/main/resources/static/docs/virtual-card-platform.postman_collection.json)

  - H2 database accessible during execution:

    👉 [H2 Console](http://localhost:8080/h2-console)

    🌟 Bonus Implementations
  </span></strong></summary>

  - Pagination support in transaction history
  - Card status (`ACTIVE`, `BLOCKED`) with enforcement
  - Version field (`@Version`) to enable optimistic concurrency
  - Rate limiting: max 5 `SPEND` transactions/minute/card
  - Swagger API documentation
  - Caching to avoid repeated queries
  - CI pipeline with **GitHub Actions** (build, test, Jacoco publish)
  - **Flyway** DB versioning for environment consistency
  - Request ID Validation – validation using requestId in transactions to make sure the same transaction isn't processed more than once, even in case of network issues or retries.
  - Cache First Strategy – Now the system checks the cache first, and only goes to the database if the data isn’t there. That helps improve performance and reduce unnecessary DB hits.
  - Global Exception Handler – organizing everything through BusinessException to keep things clean and centralized.
  - Transactional Rollback – @Transactional(rollbackFor = BusinessException.class) to ensure that if anything goes wrong in a business rule, all operations inside the process are rolled back, even those inside a Template Method flow.
  - Custom Validation per Transaction Type – validations customizable using a supports() method, so each one is only applied to the right type of transaction. It makes the system more flexible and easier to maintain.

    🧠 Technical Design Decisions
  </span></strong></summary>

  Using a rich domain model with full `Card` object instead of just `cardId` enables:

  - Referential integrity and cascaded validations
  - Easy access to card status and metadata
  - Easier extension for rules based on card state
  
  - <br>

  > This design improves expressiveness and consistency without violating business constraints.

    ⚖ Trade-offs
  </span></strong></summary>

<br>

1. Simplified Domain Models (Card & Transaction only)

    **Trade-off:**  
    Limited modeling to only two main entities (`Card` and `Transaction`) to keep the codebase small and testable.
    
    **Impact:**  
    ✅ Keeps business logic focused and isolated  
    ❌ May require refactoring when introducing related domains (e.g., User, Limits, Notifications)

2. Synchronous REST-only Communication

    **Trade-off:**  
    Used only REST APIs for card operations.
    
    **Impact:**  
    ✅ Easy to implement and test  
    ❌ Not scalable for high-throughput or event-driven scenarios (e.g., Kafka-based processing)

3. Optimistic Locking Instead of Distributed Locking

    **Trade-off:**  
    Used `@Version` field for concurrency handling instead of distributed locks (e.g., Redis-based).
    
    **Impact:**  
    ✅ Simple and safe within a single DB instance  
    ❌ May not prevent race conditions in distributed, high-concurrency environments

4. In-memory Cache Instead of Redis

    **Trade-off:**  
    Used `@Cacheable` with in-memory cache to reduce DB hits.
    
    **Impact:**  
    ✅ Zero setup; improves performance locally  
    ❌ Not suitable for horizontal scaling or shared cache between instances

5. Flyway for Versioning, No Liquibase or Schema Generation

    **Trade-off:**  
    Chose Flyway for database migrations and disabled Spring’s auto DDL generation.
    
    **Impact:**  
    ✅ Full control over schema changes, predictable  
    ❌ Requires manual script writing; no visual diffing or rollback tools built-in

6. Rate Limiting by Business Rule, Not Infrastructure

    **Trade-off:**  
    Implemented rate limiting (5 SPEND/min) in business logic instead of using an API Gateway or filter-based limiter.
    
    **Impact:**  
    ✅ Business-specific control  
    ❌ No automatic protection against DoS or broader abuse patterns

7. No Integration with External Services

    **Trade-off:**  
    The project is self-contained and doesn't simulate real external systems (e.g., card providers, fraud detection, etc.).
    
    **Impact:**  
    ✅ Simpler test scope  
    ❌ Less realistic for real-world systems with integration complexity

8. CI/CD with GitHub Actions but No Deployment Step

    **Trade-off:**  
    Configured automated tests and coverage reports, but deployment was not included.
    
    **Impact:**  
    ✅ Validates code quality early  
    ❌ Does not demonstrate production readiness (e.g., Docker, cloud deploy)

9. No Logging Framework Configured (e.g., SLF4J + Logback)

    **Trade-off:**  
    Relied on Spring Boot default logging without structuring log outputs.
    
    **Impact:**  
    ✅ Sufficient for local dev  
    ❌ Not prepared for observability or log analysis in production
